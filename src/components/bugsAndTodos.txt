While appending a piece on a tile, if the tile already contains a 
piece, where it was somehow dropped outside the image of the 
existing piece but inside the tile, then the piece gets dropped 
and appended to the tile. So the tile now has 2 pieces. 
Either enclose the image in a div that covers the entire tile,
or use tile[][] information to see if it has a Chesspiece object or not.
Added padding instead. ✨ ✅
