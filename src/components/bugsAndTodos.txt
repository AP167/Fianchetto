While appending a piece on a tile, if the tile already contains a 
piece, where it was somehow dropped outside the image of the 
existing piece but inside the tile, then the piece gets dropped 
and appended to the tile. So the tile now has 2 pieces. 
Either enclose the image in a div that covers the entire tile,
or use tile[][] information to see if it has a Chesspiece object or not.
Added padding instead. ✨ ✅

Update tile[][] information after every change. ✅

Pawns capture vertically for now, change this. ✅

Pawns cannot move 2 places in first move, change this. ✅

Check which player's turn it is. ✅

Castling
Pawn promotion  ✅
En passant
Check
Checkmate

The pawn doesn't change immediately after promotion. Find a way to call setTiles after changing
tiles value.  ✅

Keep track of x, y positions of each ChessPiece objects.

Use useState for tile data. ✅

Store data locally.

Highlight valid moves.

Fix the key prop warning.
