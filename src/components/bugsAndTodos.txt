While appending a piece on a tile, if the tile already contains a 
piece, where it was somehow dropped outside the image of the 
existing piece but inside the tile, then the piece gets dropped 
and appended to the tile. So the tile now has 2 pieces. 
Either enclose the image in a div that covers the entire tile,
or use tile[][] information to see if it has a Chesspiece object or not.
Added padding instead. ✨ ✅

Update tile[][] information after every change. ✅

Pawns capture vertically for now, change this. ✅

The pawn doesn't change immediately after promotion. Find a way to call setTiles after changing
tiles value.  ✅

If the pieces in a row are rook_b...pawn_w pawn_b...king_w and pawn_w captures pawn_b by 
en passant, it will be taken as a valid move even if the king is getting exposed to the rook. 
Put isPositionSafe() checks for en passant.  ✅

only for ids having single digit numbers.  ✅
