While appending a piece on a tile, if the tile already contains a 
piece, where it was somehow dropped outside the image of the 
existing piece but inside the tile, then the piece gets dropped 
and appended to the tile. So the tile now has 2 pieces. 
Either enclose the image in a div that covers the entire tile,
or use tile[][] information to see if it has a Chesspiece object or not.
Added padding instead. ✨ ✅

Update tile[][] information after every change. ✅

Pawns capture vertically for now, change this. ✅

Pawns cannot move 2 places in first move, change this. ✅

Check which player's turn it is. ✅

Castling  ✅
Pawn promotion  ✅
En passant  ✅
Check  ✅ 
Checkmate  ✅
Stalemate  ✅
50 move rule  ✅
75 move rule  ✅
3 fold repetition  ✅
5 fold repetition  ✅


The game can be still continued after draw, disable draggable property after result window
is shown.

The pawn doesn't change immediately after promotion. Find a way to call setTiles after changing
tiles value.  ✅

If the pieces in a row are rook_b...pawn_w pawn_b...king_w and pawn_w captures pawn_b by 
en passant, it will be taken as a valid move even if the king is getting exposed to the rook. 
Put isPositionSafe() checks for en passant.  ✅

Name the promoted pawns based on colour, otherwise the id can exceed 9 and pieceColour() works 
only for ids having single digit numbers.  ✅


Use useState for tile data. ✅

Store data locally.

Highlight valid moves.

Fix the key prop warning.
